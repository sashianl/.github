### Preliminary Steps 

1. Ensure that your repo contains the following up-to-date branches:
   - `main` or `master`
   - `develop`
   - `inbox`
2. Review your current repo's `.github/workflows/` directory if one currently exists.
3. Ensure there are no files named `pr_build.yml` or `prod_release.yml` in the `.github/workflows/` directory.
   - If these files aleady exist, they can't be added using the [Add Actions To Repository](https://github.com/jsfillman/kbase-build-guide/blob/main/guide/existing-repository.md#add-actions-to-repository) steps below.
   - If these files match the current stock [pr_build.yaml](https://github.com/kbase/.github/blob/main/workflow-templates/pr_build.yaml) & [prod_release.yaml](https://github.com/kbase/.github/blob/main/workflow-templates/prod_release.yaml), these workflows are already enabled, and you can skip to the [Enable Branch Rules](enable-branch-rules.md) section.
4. Review any other .yaml/.yml files in `.github/workflows/` to ensure they aren't redundant or are causing unnecessary failed builds.

### Add Actions To Repository

To enable the KBase build scripts on an existing [github.com/kbase](https://github.com/kbase) repo, simply:

1. Navigate to the `Actions` tab on any repository in the `kbase` organization.
2. If there are any existing Actions (workflows) enabled, click on the `New workflow` button above the list of active workflows.
   - If the repo does not have any active Actions (workflows), then a `Get started with GitHub Actions` page will appear instead.
3. Navigate to the `By KBase Software` section.
4. Click `Configure` under the `Build & Tag Images on PR` Action.
5. Click `Start commit` to add the file `pr_build.yml` to the repo.
6. Repeat steps 1-6 to add the `Build Production Release Image` (`prod_release.yml`) to the repo.
7. Use pull requests to propagate the workflow files to all active branches including: 
   - `main`/`master` 
   - `develop`
   - `inbox`
   - Any active feature branches
