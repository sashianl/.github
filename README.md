## KBase Build & Release Guide

This guide describes how to set up and use the standard KBase build and release scripts.
These scripts allow KBase developers to:

- Automatically build test images when a pull request is created
- Tag images as `latest` once a pull request is merged
- Create production-ready images with semantic versions (e.g. `1.1.4`) using GitHub's [Release](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/releasing-projects-on-github/about-releases) process
- Enable repos to use optional fully automated [continuous deployment](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_deployment) to development (e.g. `CI`) enviroments once these environments are deployed on Rancher2.
